### Customer Segmentation Classification
#### Abstract
An automobile company plans to enter new markets, and they have deduced that the
behavior of the new market is similar to their existing market, in which the sales team had
classified all customers into 4 segments (A, B, C, D) and found this strategy to work
exceptionally well. In this study our aim is to analyze data of the previous customers and try to
classify potential customers from the new automobile industry market into the four segments.
